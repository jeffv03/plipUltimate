PCB REVISION 2.1 NOTES

This revision was designed as experimental to prototype things and as such
it is not designed in best way. Assemble at your own risk! If you are
faint-hearted or want all the features, just wait for rev3.

1. There are some bugs on PCB, so power selection WILL NOT work. Don't even
bother soldering MOSFETs. When assembling, you have to decide, if you want to
power it from passive PoE OR micro USB.

1.A. When powering from passive PoE:

 - don't solder U5, U6, R11, R12, D3 and CON4;
 - connect U3's pad 4 with either U6 pad 1 or 6, or C18's "+" pad;
 - connect U5's pad 1 with either pad 3 or 7, or C18's "-" pad.
 For U3 and L2, turn your iron to 450 Celsius.
 
1.B. When powering from micro USB:

- don't solder U3, U5, U6, C15, R11, R12, D2, D3 and L2;
- connect U6's pad 3 with 1 or 6;
- connect U5's pad 6 with 3 or 7.
 
2. U7's biggest pad (plate) is mistakenly connected to GND. You must cut traces
between this pad and rest of ground plane with as large margin as possible,
or cover it in kapton and solder remaining leads. Be sure you've isolated this
pad correctly, because after soldering your multimeter buzzer won't indicate
connection properly. Who the hell designs IC with biggest heat flow
not connected to GND?

BE SURE TO COMPLY TO STEPS 1 AND 2, OTHERWISE YOU _WILL_ BURN THIS PIECE OF JUNK

Also, there are problems with CON3 and CON5 footprints. It may be necessary
to cut CON3's LED leads and mechanical pins. R9 and R10 are then not needed.
Also CON5 mechanical holes may be too small.
